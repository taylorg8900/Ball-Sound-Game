game elements
    ball
        placed when user left clicks
        maybe holding left click makes a bigger ball?
        continuously drops from point every second if user middle clicks
        has gravity
        makes noise when it hits lines
        pitch of noise depends on length of line
        bounces off lines, has acceleration
    ball spawner
        placed when user middle clicks
        if user left clicks on it, raise speed of spawning balls
        if user right clicks on it, lower speed of spawning balls
        if speed of spawning balls gets to 0, delete object
    lines that are created between two nodes
        stores info about how long they are
        stores info about angle of line, to calculate bounce path of ball
    nodes that are placed when user right clicks
        lines are created when two subsequent nodes are placed

floating text idea
    - moves up with each tick
    - gets more faded out with each tick
    - position depends on spawners
    - activates when speeding up or slowing down spawners
    - will have to updated each loop, probably next to the updating for balls and lines and nodes and spawners


design
ROBS IDEA
can make the game about getting the ball into a hole, using the lines to bounce it in
make it like flappy golf, where hitting a or d modifies the balls path
dylans idea
    add death laser obstacles
