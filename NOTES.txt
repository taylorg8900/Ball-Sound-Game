what to work on next


- calculating the length of lines
    used in making noise based on length

- mabye a giant button somewhere that lets you reset everything without having to close the window
- expand lines if left click, like the power lines in satisfactory adding power poles and the cables between them
    drawing from a node and creating a new node
- maybe move the lines by clicking on nodes and clicking somewhere else
- ball explosion of like 20 bawls if i hit number 6 or something like the bounce house demo from 11.2 in class
- maybe special colored lines that would multiply whatever balls hit it by 2 or 3
    would need to copy the ball that hit and change its x and y velocity slightly for this
-   have a color wheel in another corner for user to keep track of which color line they have selected

have user input for raising or lowering size of all balls on screen
have user input for changing colors of balls, like hitting a button would randomly color shift all balls
    option to return all to white
    or option to have a constant transition between colors like rainbow color cycling idk what it is called
have user input to change gravity maybe? idk cuz that pretty much just makes thing slow
    between .01 and .1 (default)
'random' spawners that have balls of random size and random gravity
option select menu on the side for people who dont want to hit buttons for each of these
    balls, nodes, spawners, ball explosion, color change, etc are a lot of options
    having a dropdown menu for selecting them would be cool




COMPLETED TASKS
- adding keyboard functionality
-optimizing the clicking logic
-removing balls if they go off the screen
- stop balls from clipping into lines (maybe) (idk i kind of like it)
-getting ball spawners to work
- having text appear all floaty above spawners when you increase or decrease their speed

things chatgpt helped me with
    gave formula for calculating reflection angle (i guess i couldve googled this too)
    explained how to make masks, specifically the transparency part
    explained how to change transparency of text
        do this with text.set_alpha(example number)
